## Psychology & Behavioral Analytics

### Cognitive Biases Detected

The system automatically identifies:

1. **Confirmation Bias**
   - Seeking information that confirms your view
   - Mitigation: Actively search for contrary evidence

2. **Anchoring Bias**
   - Over-reliance on first information received
   - Mitigation: Reset your analysis from scratch

3. **Recency Bias**
   - Giving too much weight to recent events
   - Mitigation: Review longer-term data

4. **Overconfidence Bias**
   - High confidence trades with poor outcomes
   - Mitigation: Double-check analysis, reduce size

5. **Loss Aversion**
   - Fear of losses leading to poor decisions
   - Mitigation: Accept losses as part of trading

6. **Gambler's Fallacy**
   - Believing past randomness affects future
   - Mitigation: Each trade is independent

7. **Herd Mentality**
   - Following the crowd (FOMO)
   - Mitigation: Stick to your strategy

8. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**
   - Holding losers because of prior investment
   - Mitigation: Cut losses according to plan

### Pattern Insights

The analytics engine identifies:
- **High Stress Trading**: Correlation between stress and losses
- **FOMO Trading**: Chasing trades without proper setups
- **Revenge Trading**: Trading to recover losses
- **Overtrading**: Excessive trade frequency
- **Optimal Trading Hours**: When you perform best
- **Emotion-Performance Correlation**: Which emotions lead to wins/losses

### Discipline Metrics

Tracked automatically:
- **Plan Adherence Rate**: % of trades following your plan
- **Stop Loss Adherence**: Respecting predetermined stops
