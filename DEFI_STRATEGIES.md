## Risk Management

### Health Factor Monitoring

For borrowing positions, always maintain:
- **Critical**: Health Factor < 1.1 (Immediate action required)
- **High Risk**: Health Factor 1.1-1.5 (Close monitoring)
- **Medium Risk**: Health Factor 1.5-2.0 (Regular checks)
- **Low Risk**: Health Factor > 2.0 (Safe zone)

### Position Sizing

- Never allocate more than 30% of portfolio to a single protocol
- Keep 10-20% in liquid stablecoins for emergencies
- Start small and scale as you gain experience

### Auto-Compounding Guidelines

**When to Enable**:
- Positions with pending rewards > $10 USD
- Frequency: 24-48 hours for most positions
- Ensure gas costs don't exceed 2% of rewards

**Slippage Tolerance**:
- Stablecoin swaps: 0.5-1%
- Volatile pairs: 1-2%
